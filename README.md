Learn pygame with some simple examples

Pygame is a fun and powerful module that lets you use python to create simple games.

These examples are designed to help 11-16 year old students get started using pygame. 

They are not supposed to be a complete reference manual for everything that pygame can do - 
just a couple of quick examples to get you started.

Please look at the Wiki page for more information about how to get started and where to go for more detailed help.
